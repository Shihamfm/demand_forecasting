# Project Overview – Walmart-Style Demand Forecasting

This project focuses on item-level demand forecasting using a synthetic Walmart-like retail transaction dataset.
The primary objective is to forecast the next 14 days of sales (units sold) at a Store × Item × Day granularity, closely reflecting real-world retail demand planning systems.

The dataset spans January 2024 to December 2025 and contains 50,000 transaction records, incorporating key business drivers such as promotions, holidays, pricing, footfall, and external factors like weather and temperature.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end demand forecasting workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering (lag features, rolling statistics), model training, and multi-day forecasting using machine learning and time-series techniques.
